### Hi, I'm  Julio👋

Graduated in Air Transport Management and Operations at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid with experience in both air and land transportation ‍. Recently, my interest in data analysis and its application to decision-making has grown significantly. This, along with the knowledge I gained from a data analysis bootcamp, motivated me to pursue this exciting and challenging new field. I'm actively seeking a role or job where I can leverage my existing skills, learn new ones, and apply my data analysis knowledge.

💡 Python with libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit

💡 SQL for relational database management and manipulation

Eager to contribute to new projects and learn from this community, excited to hear new ideas and suggestions!
